Description: Quantification of variation in organismal color patterns as
    obtained from image data. Patternize defines homology between pattern positions
    across images either through fixed landmarks or image registration. Pattern
    identification is performed by categorizing the distribution of colors using RGB
    thresholds or image segmentation.
